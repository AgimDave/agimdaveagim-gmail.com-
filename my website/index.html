On the negative side, if proper measures are not taken, like using safe and hygienic practices, there can be risks of infections or damage to the natural nails. It's important to prioritize nail health and seek professional help when needed.</p>
	<p><b>Here are a few tips to help you get started in fixing nails:</b></p>
	<ol>
		<li>Choose your colors: Pick two or more nail polish shades that blend well together. For a classic ombre look, you can go for shades within the same color family or try contrasting colors for a bold effect.</li>
		<li>Prep your nails: Start by shaping and buffing your nails. Apply a base coat to protect your nails and create a smooth surface for the polish</li>
		<li>Paint the base: Apply the lighter shade as your base color and let it dry completely. This will serve as the starting point for your ombre design.</li>
		<li>Sponge technique: Take a makeup sponge and apply a small amount of the darker shade(s) onto the sponge. Gently press the sponge onto your nail, starting from the tip and working your way up towards the base. Repeat this step until you achieve the desired gradient effect.</li>
		<li>Blend and refine: Use a clean brush or sponge to blend the colors together, creating a seamless transition between shades. You can also use a small brush dipped in nail polish remover to clean up any excess polish around the cuticles.</li>
		<li>Seal the deal: Once you're happy with the ombre effect, apply a glossy top coat to protect your design and give it a polished finish.</li>
		<p>Remember, practice makes perfect! Don't be afraid to experiment with different color combinations and techniques to create your own unique ombre nail designs. Have fun and enjoy the process!</p>
